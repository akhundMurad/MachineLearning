### Classic vs. Machine Learning Paradigm

- **Classic Approach:**
  - Leverages pre-programmed rules for processing inputs into useful output data.

- **Machine Learning Paradigm:**
  - Examines input and corresponding output data in order to deduce the underlying rules.

### Components of Machine Learning

Machine learning involves three key components:

1. **Control Input Data:** Examples include records with human voices, images of different objects.

2. **Expected Results:** Such as transcription of human speech or classified images.

3. **Algorithm Quality Evaluation Method:** Necessary to correct algorithm behavior; this process is known as learning.

### Learning in Machine Learning

- **Definition:** Describes the process of automatic transformation search, creating valuable transformations for specific data, guided by a feedback signal.

### Hypothesis Space

- **Definition:**
  - The set of all possible legal hypotheses.
  - The machine learning algorithm selects the best hypothesis that accurately describes the target function or outputs.

## Deep Learning

- **Definition:**
  - A special branch of machine learning.
  - Emphasizes learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations of data.

By understanding the components of machine learning and the unique characteristics of deep learning, we can appreciate the evolution from classical approaches to the more sophisticated paradigms that enhance the capability of automatic data processing.
